			<h3>THANK YOU FOR JOINING CHICAGO DSA!</h3>
			<p>The Democratic Socialists of America is the fastest growing socialist organization in the United States today. We woudln't
				be able to say that without new members like you joining us. And so we'd like to thank you for joining our organization
				as we work towards building a socialistier America.</p>
			<a name="why"></a>
			<h3>WHAT DOES CDSA DO?</h3>
			<p>The Chicago Democratic Socialists of America's mission is to establish democratic socialism as a political force in the
				United States and around the world by training and mobilizing socialist activists to participate in a vibrant and diverse
				socialist organization at both the local and the national level. DSA both educates the public about democratic socialist
				values and policies and builds progressive coalitions to win victories that move the U.S. and the world toward social
				democracy. In the near term, democratic socialists struggle for reforms that shift power and resources away from corporate
				elites and put them in the hands of ordinary citizens. In the long term, democratic socialists fight for a world in which
				all people share equally in the governing of the economic, political and cultural institutions and relationships that
				shape their lives. </p>

			<h3>WHAT IS TO BE DONE</h3>
			<p>The heart of Chicago DSA is our Working Groups. Through these small, self-organized units, we promote strategies and advance
				tactics in our communities that forward a working-class-centered politics of humanity and solidarity, effect positive
				change in Chicago’s neighborhoods, and build relationships with other organizations with similar values and goals. Our
				current Working Groups include Anti-Racism, Communications, Electoral, Environmental Justice, Health Care, Housing, Labor,
				Public Education, Rapid Response, Service Assistance Initiative, Socialist Feminist, Solidarity Economy, as well as several
				reading groups and caucuses. New Working Groups are also forming — there’s sure to be something that will let you get
				involved with the DSA in a way that speaks to your motivations.</p>

			<h3>CONFLICT RESOLUTION</h3>
			<p>Harassment is bad so don't do it..... for real tho um I can't find the official policy right now but having it in the
				new member guide would be a suuuuuuper good idea.</p>
